"""Session modes — Learn, Pair Programming, and Autonomous.

Each mode changes how the orchestrator routes work through the agent graph:

- **Learn**: Teacher-led.  The teacher agent explains concepts as code is
  written.  The coding agent writes code but always includes explanations.
  The user is in teaching mode — concepts are surfaced prominently.

- **Pair Programming**: Collaborative.  The coding agent writes code and
  the teacher agent identifies concepts in the background.  The user
  drives decisions but the AI assists with implementation.

- **Autonomous**: Full automation.  The coding agent runs with minimal
  explanation.  The teacher agent only surfaces critical concepts.
  Focus is on getting things done.
