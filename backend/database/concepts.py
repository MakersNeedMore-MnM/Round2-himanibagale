"""Concept storage — persists learned concepts per session.

Storage is a single SQLite database (``~/.codelith/codelith.db``) with three
tables — ``concepts``, ``teachings``, ``assessments`` — mirroring the
previous three JSON stores.  WAL journal mode is enabled so the daemon
can write while the dashboard reads concurrently without
``database is locked`` errors.

Concepts are keyed by *identity*: a stable slug derived from the concept
name, not by which file it happened to appear in.  A concept carries a
``content_hash`` of the underlying code it was detected from, so the
detect node can reuse a previously stored explanation/diagram without
recomputing when the concept resurfaces — in the same file or a
different one — and only recompute when the underlying code actually
changed.
