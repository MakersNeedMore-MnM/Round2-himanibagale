"""Teacher Agent — saves teaching content and answers user questions.

Concept detection no longer happens here: the shared ``detect_concepts``
node (see :mod:`backend.agents.concept_detector`) runs once per turn and
writes ``state["concepts_detected"]``.  This node reads that shared result
and turns the new concepts into teaching entries on the dashboard.

When the user asks a question in the terminal, the teacher agent answers
it there directly instead.
