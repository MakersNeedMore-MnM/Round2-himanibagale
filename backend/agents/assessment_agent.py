"""Assessment Agent — generates Socratic questions based on detected concepts.

When the coding agent uses a programming concept (e.g. useState, async/await),
this agent generates a question to test the user's understanding.  Questions
are stored for the dashboard to display — not printed in the terminal.

Concept detection itself happens upstream in the shared ``detect_concepts``
node (see :mod:`backend.agents.concept_detector`); this node reads the shared
``concepts_detected`` result instead of re-scanning tool calls.

The teacher agent then saves the teaching content to the dashboard as well.
